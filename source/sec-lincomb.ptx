  <title>Linear Combinations</title>

  <p> 
    We have previously seen that the solution set to a linear system can take on different forms: a single point, a line, a plane, etc. In the case of a line <m>L</m>, 
    we saw that we can take a vector <m>\mathbf{v}</m> that lies on <m>L</m>, and reach any other vector that lies on <m>L</m> by scaling <m>\mathbf{v}</m> by a constant. 
    In the case of a plane, we can use two vectors that don't lie on a common line (more on this later) and use their multiples to sweep out the plane.

    Now we introduce notation that captures this idea a little more formally.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-span">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>\mathcal{C}=\{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}</m> is a collection of vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>. The "span" of <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is a new 
        collection of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in <m>\mathcal{C}</m>:
        <me> \text{Span}(\mathcal{C})=\{c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \cdots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n \mid c_i \in \mathbb{R}\}.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p> 
    For example, the following manimation shows that the span of a single non-zero vector is a line.
    Caution: Scaling the zero vector leaves it unchanged, and so <m>\text{Span}(\mathbf{0})=\{\mathbf{0}\}</m>. Outside of this example, the span of a 
    finite collection of vectors always contains an infinite amount of vectors.
