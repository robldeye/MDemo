  <title>Linear Combinations</title>

  <p> 
    We have previously seen that the solution set to a linear system can take on different forms: a single point, a line, a plane, etc. In the case of a line <m>L</m>, we saw that we can take a vector <m>\mathbf{v}</m> that lies on <m>L</m>, 
    and reach any other vector that lies on <m>L</m> by scaling <m>\mathbf{v}</m> by a constant. In the case of a plane, we can use two vectors that don't lie on a common line (more on this later) and use their multiples to sweep out the plane. 
    Now we introduce notation that captures this idea a little more formally.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>\mathcal{C}=\{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n}\}</m> is a collection of vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>. The "span" of <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is a new 
        collection of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in <m>\mathcal{C}</m>:
        <me> \text{Span}(\mathcal{C})=\{c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \cdots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n \mid c_i \in \mathbb{R}\}.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p> 
    For example, the following manimation shows that the span of a single non-zero vector is a line.
    <video source="TransformGridWithBasisVectors.mp4"/>
    Caution: Scaling the zero vector leaves it unchanged, and so <m>\text{Span}(\mathbf{0})=\{\mathbf{0}\}</m>. Outside of this example, the span of a finite collection of vectors will always contains an infinite amount of vectors.

  <exercise>
    <title> What can go wrong?</title>
      <p> Consider the function <m> f(t)=t^2-4 </m>. In the animation below <m> t \to 1 </m>.</p>
  
  <video source="SingularMatrix.mp4"/>

  <p>
    We see that <m> f(t) \to -3 </m> as <m> t \to 1 </m> from either side. this veries that
    <me> \lim_{t \to 1}f(t)=-3 </me>.
