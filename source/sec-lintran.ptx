  <title>Linear Transformations</title>

  <p> 
    Most of our focus on the matrix equation <m> A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b} </m> has been devoted to fixing some vector <m> \mathbf{x} </m> and then finding all solution vectors <m> \mathbf{x} </m>. Recalling consistency,
    let's think about which <m> \mathbf{b} </m> admit solutions to the matrix equation. It will be helpful to think of a matrix <m> A </m> as a function:
    <me>
        A(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{b},
    </me>
    that takes in vectors <m> \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n </m> and outputs a new vector <m> A(\mathbf{x}) \in \mathbb{R}^m </m>. Suppose <m> n = m </m>, so that the input and output vectors all lie in the same space.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can visualize the effect of this matrix function on vectors in the plane in the following two examples.
  </p>

  <exercise>
    <title>Protypical Example</title>
    <p> 
      Suppose 
      <me>A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp -1 \\ -1 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</me>.
      Watch what happens to the coordinate axes 
      <me>\text{Span}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\right) \text{ and } \text{Span}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\right)</me>:
    </p>

    <p>
      We see that <m>A</m> takes the plane with standard coordinate axes and contorts it into a kind of 'sheared' plane.
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <title>What can go wrong?</title>
    <p>
      Suppose <me>A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp -1 \\ -1 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</me>. Watch what happens to the coordinate axes 
      <me>\text{Span}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\right) \text{ and } \text{Span}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\right)</me>:
    </p>
  
    <video source="SingularTransform2D.mp4"/>

    <p>
      Notice that 
      <me>\text{Span}\left(A\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}\right) = \text{Span}\left(A\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\right)</me>. 
      Applying this matrix to the vectors of the plane effectively 'collapses' the plane to a line. Even though we are not yet equipped with the formal definition of 'dimension',
      our intuition tells us that it must encode that a plane is 2-dimensional and a line is 1-dimensional.
    </p>

  </exercise>

  <p>
    The only difference between the two exercises above lied in the (<m>2 \times 2</m>)-matrices that we used. How do their RREF compare?
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's increase dimension a little by considering the effect of a (<m>3 \times 3</m>)-matrix <m>A</m> acting on <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
  </p>

  <exercise>
    <title>Higher dimensions</title>
    <p>
      Suppose <me>A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\ -1 \amp 1 \amp -2 \\ 0.5 \amp -0.5 \amp 1\end{bmatrix}</me>. Watch what happens to the coordinate axes <m> \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3</m>:
    </p>
  
    <video source="SingularTransform3D.mp4"/>

    <p>
      Once again, we have
      <me>\text{Span}(A\mathbf{v}_1) = \text{Span}(A\mathbf{v}_2) = \text{Span}(A\mathbf{v}_3)</me>. 
      This time, <m>A</m> acts on three-space by collapsing everything to a line.
    </p>

  </exercise>
