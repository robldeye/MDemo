  <title>Limits</title>

  <p> 
    What does it mean to say that the value of a function approaches a specific quantity? As <m>t</m> changes, so too does the value of a given function <m>f(t)</m>. We would like to use the notation 
    <me>f(t) \to L \text{ as } t \to a</me> 
    to mean that the function values <m>f(t)</m> get closer to some <m>y</m>-value <m>L</m> as a consequence of <m>t</m> getting closer to some <m>t</m>-value <m>a</m>.
  </p>

    <title> Motivating Limits</title>
      <p> Consider the function <m> f(t)=t^2-4 </m>. Let's watch in the manimation below what happens when <m> t \to 1 </m>.</p>
  
  <video source="TransformGridWithBasisVectors.mp4"/>

  <p>
    We see that <m> f(t) \to -3 </m> as <m> t \to 1 </m> from either side. this veries that
    <me> \lim_{t \to 1}f(t)=-3 </me>.

    <title> What can go wrong?</title>
      <p> Consider the function <m> f(t)=t^2-4 </m>. In the animation below <m> t \to 1 </m>.</p>
  
  <video source="TransformGridWithBasisVectors.mp4"/>

  <p>
    We see that <m> f(t) \to -3 </m> as <m> t \to 1 </m> from either side. this veries that
    <me> \lim_{t \to 1}f(t)=-3 </me>.
