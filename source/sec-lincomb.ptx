  <title>Linear Combinations</title>

  <p> 
    We have previously seen that the solution set to a linear system can take on different forms: a single point, a line, a plane, etc. In the case of a line <m>L</m>, 
    we saw that we can take a vector <m>\mathbf{v}</m> that lies on <m>L</m>, and reach any other vector that lies on <m>L</m> by scaling <m>\mathbf{v}</m> by a constant. 
    In the case of a plane, we can use two vectors that don't lie on a common line (more on this later) and use their multiples to sweep out the plane. 
    Now we introduce notation that captures this idea a little more formally.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-span">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>\mathcal{C}=\{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}</m> is a collection of vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>. The "span" of <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is a new 
        collection of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in <m>\mathcal{C}</m>:
        <me> \text{Span}(\mathcal{C})=\{c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \cdots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n \mid c_i \in \mathbb{R}\}.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p> 
    For example, the following manimation shows that the span of a single non-zero vector is a line.
    Caution: Scaling the zero vector leaves it unchanged, and so <m>\text{Span}(\mathbf{0})=\{\mathbf{0}\}</m>. Outside of this example, the span of a 
    finite collection of vectors will always contains an infinite amount of vectors.

    Let's take a look at how matrix multiplication affects vectors.
  </p>

  <exercise>
    <title>Protypical Example</title>
    <p> 
      Suppose 
      <me>A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp -1 \\ -1 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</me>.
      Watch what happens to the coordinate axes 
      <me>\text{Span}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\right) \text{ and } \text{Span}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\right)</me>:
    </p>
  
    <video source="TransformGridWithBasisVectors.mp4"/>

    <p>
      We see that <m>A</m> takes the plane with standard coordinate axes and contorts it into a kind of 'sheared' plane.
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <title>What can go wrong?</title>
    <p>
      Suppose <me>A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp -1 \\ -1 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix}</me>. Watch what happens to the coordinate axes 
      <me>\text{Span}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\right) \text{ and } \text{Span}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\right)</me>:
    </p>
  
    <video source="SingularMatrix.mp4"/>

    <p>
      Notice that 
      <me>\text{Span}\left(A\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}\right) = \text{Span}\left(A\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\right)</me>. 
      Applying this matrix to the vectors of the plane effectively 'collapses' the plane to a line. Even though we are not yet equipped with the formal definition of 'dimension',
      our intuition tells us that it must encode that a plane is 2-dimensional and a line is 1-dimensional. How can we foresee this happening based on the data contained in 
      <m>A</m>?
