  <title>Limits</title>

  <p> 
    What does it mean to say that the value of a function approaches a specific quantity? As <m>x</m> changes, so too does the value of a given function <m>f(x)</m>. We would like to use the notation 
    <me>f(x) \to L \text{ as } x \to a</me> 
    to mean that the function values <m>f(x)</m> get closer to some <m>y</m>-value <m>L</m> as a consequence of <m>x</m> getting closer to some <m>x</m>-value <m>a</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A real-valued function <m>f(x)</m> can only approach <m>L</m> from two sides, and these are captured by how <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> from the left and right. Let's see a prototypical example of what happens when everything goes right.

  <exercise>
    <title> Good Example </title>
      <p> Consider the function <m> f(x)=x^2-4 </m>. Let's watch in the manimation below what happens when <m> x \to 1 </m> from both sides.</p>
  
  <video source="Limit.mp4"/>

  <p>
    We see that <m> f(x) \to -3 </m> as <m> x \to 1 </m> from either side. This verifies that <m>f(x) \to -3</m> as <m>x \to 1</m>, or
    <me> \lim_{x \to 1}f(x)=-3 </me>.
  </p>

    Now let's think about how this limiting process could fail. We can create such an example by forcing a break in the graph of a function - piecewise-defined functions are great for this.
    To make sense of which side we approach the break from, we can use notation <m> x \to a^- </m> and <m> x \to a^+ </m> to denote <m>x</m> approaching <m>a</m> from the left or right side, respectively.

  <exercise>
    <title> Bad Example </title>
      <p> Consider the function 
        <me> f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2-3 \amp x \leq 1 \\ x^2+1 \amp x>1\end{cases}</me>
        Let's watch in the manimation below what happens when <m> x \to 1 </m> from both sides.
      </p>

  <p>
    Here we see that <m>f(x)</m> approaches <m>-3</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>1</m> from the left, and that <m>f(x)</m> approaches <m>2</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>1</m> from the right. In other words,
    <me> \lim_{x \to 1^-}f(x)=-3 \neq 2 = \lim_{x \to 1^+}f(x)</me>. The function does not approach the same <m>y</m>-value as <m>x \to 1</m>, and so we say that the limit does not exist.
