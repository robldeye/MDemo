    What does it mean to say that the value of a function approaches a specific quantity? As <m>t</m> changes, the value of a given function <m>f(t)</m> changes as well. Intuitively, we think that the statement 
    <me>f(t) \text{ approaches } L \text{ as } t \text{ approaches } a"</me> 
    to mean...

    For the function <m> f(t)=t^2-4 </m>, we can watch how the values of <m>f</m> move closer to <m>L=-3</m> as <m>t</m> approaches <m>1</m> from either side. This verifies that
    <me> \lim_{t \to 1}f(t)=-3 </me>
